    @template local_classreport/tabs

    This template renders the year selector as a sequence of tabs.
    Differs slightly from core/tabs in that tabs have no content and cause postback

    Example context (json):
     {
        "tabs": [
            {
            	"year": 7,
            	"active": "active",
            	"url": "#index.php?year=7"
            },{
                "year": 8,
                "active": "",
                "url": "#index.php?year=8"
            },{
                "year": 9,
                "active": "",
                "url": "#index.php?year=9"
            }
        ]
    }

}}
